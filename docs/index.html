<p>Podemos ver que la base de datos cuenta con 2784 filas y 41 columnas. Con <strong>summary</strong> podemos tener una vision general de las variables, por ejmplo, podemos ver que los datos corresponden a las Grandes Ligas de Beisbol entre 1876 y 2020, asÃ­ como podemos ver estadÃ­sticas bÃ¡sicas de las variables numÃ©ricas e identificar la clase de todas las variables. Hay algunas que contienen NAâs, por ejemplo, <em>strikeouts_by_batters</em> y <em>sacrifice_flies</em>, variables muy especificas del desempeÃ±o de los jugadores y de los equipos. Teniendo en cuenta esta revisiÃ³n general, se plantean las siguientes preguntas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Â¿CÃ³mo ha sido el desempeÃ±o (<em>Rank</em>) de los equipos de besisbol a traves de los aÃ±os?</p></li>
<li><p>Â¿CuÃ¡ntos de los equipos en el top 20 de los que han jugado mas juegos, han jugado en casa y han jugado la liga NL? Â¿CuÃ¡ntos la liga AL? Â¿CuÃ¡les?</p></li>
<li><p>Â¿CuÃ¡les equipos con un nombre de mas de dos palabras tienen mas de 3000 outs_pitches y han tenido menos errores que la media por aÃ±o entre 1950-2020 y a quÃ© ligas pertenecen?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Para contestar las preguntas se utilizÃ³ el cÃ³digo que se muestra a continuaciÃ³n. Para manipular los datos se empleÃ³ uno de los paquetes vistos en el curso â<strong>data.table</strong>â, <strong>p</strong>ara las funciones se utilizÃ³ <strong>programaciÃ³n defensiva</strong> y para los grÃ¡ficos se utilizÃ³ <strong>ggplot</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Â¿CÃ³mo ha sido el desempeÃ±o (<em>Rank</em>) de los equipos de besisbol a traves de los aÃ±os?: En la grÃ¡fica se puede ver que el nÃºmero de juegos jugados en general ha aumentado a lo largo de los aÃ±os y ha disminuido su variabilidad, exceptuando algunos aÃ±os en los que hubo menor cantidad de juegos y mayor varibilidad: 1918, 1919, 1972, 1981, 1994, 1995 y 2020. El nÃºmero de juegos tuvo un crecimiento rÃ¡pido entre 1876 y 1900, que se estabilizÃ³ despuÃ©s de 1900 y luego tuvo un ligero aumento a partir de 1960. En cuanto al desempeÃ±o de los equipos, se puede ver que ha tendido a mejorar, sin embargo, se puede ver que los puntos de cambio en la tendencia se ven rodeados de bajos rendimientos en los equipos.</p>

<li><p>Â¿CuÃ¡ntos de los equipos en el top 20 de los que han jugado mas juegos, han jugado en casa y han jugado la liga NL? Â¿CuÃ¡ntos la liga AL? Â¿CuÃ¡les?</p>
<p>Para esta pregunta se realizÃ³ una funciÃ³n para encontrar el top x de equipos dada una variable. AdemÃ¡s, se utilizÃ³ <strong>programaciÃ³n defensiva</strong>, uno de los temas vistos en el curso, para asegurar que la funciÃ³n corra adecuadamente y si no que retorne un mensaje indicando el error.</p>

<p>Se puede ver que efectivamente los grupos tienen un nÃºmero de errores menor que la media entre los aÃ±os 1950 y 2020, ademÃ¡s, se observa que los equipos solo participaron al tiempo en las grandes ligas de baseball entre el 2005 y el 2007. Por otro lado, hay una tendencia decreciente del nÃºmero de errores a lo largo de los aÃ±os, mostrando una mejora en el desempeÃ±o de los equipos.</p></li>
